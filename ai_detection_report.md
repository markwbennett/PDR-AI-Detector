## PD-0333-24 PDR (refused).pdf

- **Confidence:** 85%

### AI Indicators:

- Consistent use of formal but somewhat stilted phrases like 'Combined with the angle of attack, the jury heard evidence supporting a conclusion'
- The argument sections in the petition follow an unusually rigid and repetitive structure that seems templated rather than naturally written
- Citations and legal principles are presented in an overly systematic way that lacks the natural integration typically found in human legal writing
